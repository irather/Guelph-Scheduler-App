* I think we could use selenium for front end testing
* Some useful docs

* For browser testing automation, Selenium contains a server that opens a browser and establishes a communication with it. Selenium Webdriver operates by accepting the commands and sending the received commands to a browser and then interacting with the applications. The WebDriver acts as a client for the server.
*  Can be installed via node or pip
* Can be used for end to end testing
* we need Selenium WebDriver for the specific web browser to automate (IE/Firefox/Chrome/Edge)
