## Git Usage
- To calculate the weight for a specific assignee, go to the boards tab and using the search bar, 
  search for the assignee you wish to total the weight for along with the milestone (the sprint). 
  After seaching, add the weights from the open issues to the closed issues to find the total
  assigned weight to a person for the sprint.
- Each sprint branch should be branched off of main
- Each time a new issue is created make sure it has the appropriate sprint associated with it
  as a milestone
- create branches based on issue number as 'issue-#' where '#' is the issue number. After the
  issue is complete, merge it with the correct sprint branch. NEVER MERGE TO MAIN.
