How to restart the server after making changes

if you made changes to the flask portion (app.py)
* Save your changes
* Type: “sudo systemctl daemon-reload” to end the daemon/process that running the flask program
* Type “sudo systemctl start scheduler-app” to let a process run the flask portion

if you made changes to the react portion (app.js)
* Cd to home/socs/CIS3760-team-302/scheduler-app and run “npm run build”
* afterwards Nginx should always be watching the react portion and you should already see the changes on the server but if not
* Run “sudo nginx -s reload”


To close the server just run “sudo nginx -s stop"
