*I found lighthouse to be one of the most simple front end testing tool
*The great thing about lighthouse is that it is built directly into google chrome so there is no need to install any additional libraries or 
dependencies
*It can help cath things like missing descriptor tags, Accessibility checks and much more
*Altough I did not encounter any method in my research to implement it into our CI/CD I do believe given its simplicity and 
ease of use it is a viable option to look into
